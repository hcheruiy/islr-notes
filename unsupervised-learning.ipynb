    "\n",
    "The most common type of hierarchical clustering is bottom-up or __agglomerative clustering__ in which the dendrogram is built starting from the leaves and combining clusters up to the trunk. Based on this, it is not hard to see that the earlier observations or branches fuse together, the more similar they are. Observations that fuse later, near the top of the tree, can be quite different. The height at which two observations fuse together is indicative of how different the observations are.\n",

For example, splitting a group of people in to sexes and splitting a group of people by race yield clusters that aren’t necessarily hierarchical in structure. Because of this, hierarchical clustering can sometimes yield worse results than K-means clustering.\n",

    "The hierarchical clustering dendrogram is obtained by first selecting some sort of measure of dissimilarity between the each pair of observations; often Euclidean distance is used. Starting at the bottom of the dendrogram, each of the n observations is treated as its own cluster.

This process is repeated until all the observations belong to a single cluster and the dendrogram is complete.\n",

Average, complete and single linkage are most popular among statisticians. Centroid linkage is often used in genomics.
