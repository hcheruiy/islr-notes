If the number of observations is much larger than the number of variables, least squares estimates will tend to have low variance too. If the number of observations is not much larger than the number of variables there can can be a lot of variability to the least squares fit leading to overfitting and poor predictions. When there are fewer observations than there are variables, no unique least squares estimate exists and the method cannot be used. Constraining or shrinking the estimated coefficients can reduce variance while incurring only a negligible increase in bias.\n",

    "\n",
    "It should be noted that step 3 of the above algorithm should be performed with care because as the number of features used by the models increases, the residual sum of squares decreases monotonically and the $R^2$ increases monotonically. Because of this, picking the statistically best model will always yield the model involving all of the variables. This stems from the fact that residual sum of squares and $R^2$ are measures of training error and it’d be better to select the best model based on low test error. For this reason, step 3 utilizes cross-validated prediction error, Cp, Bayes information criterion, or adjusted $R^2$ to select the best models.\n",

    "Best subset selection can also be employed for other learning techniques such as logistic regression. For example, in the case of logistic regression, instead of using residual sum of squares or $R^2$ to order models in step 2 of the above algorithm, a measure that substitutes for residual sum of squares in a broader class of models known as deviance is used. Deviance is negative two times the maximized log-likelihood. The smaller the deviance, the better the fit of the model.\n",

As such, best subset selection becomes computationally infeasible for values of $p$ greater than $\\approx 40$. Some computational shortcuts, known as branch-and-bound techniques help eliminate some of the model evaluation but they only work for least squares linear regression and they still face limitations as $p$ gets large because it becomes more likely that models are encountered that look good on the training data though they may have no predictive power on new data. As should be obvious, this leads to overfitting and high variance.\n",

Another way of looking at it is that regardless of how the jth predictor is scaled, the value of $\\mathbf{X}_j\\beta_j$ remains the same. In contrast, ridge regression coefficients can change dramatically when the scale of a given predictor is changed.

    "Ridge regression’s advantage over least squares stems from the __bias-variance trade-off__. As the tuning parameter $\\lambda$ increases, the flexibility of the ridge regression fit decreases leading to a decrease in variance, but also causing an increase in bias. Since least squares is equivalent to the most flexible form of ridge regression (where $\\lambda = 0$) it offers less bias at the cost of higher variance. As such, ridge regression is best employed in situations where least squares estimates have high variance.\n",

    "Principal component analysis (PCA) is a technique for reducing the dimension of an $n \\times p$ data matrix $\\mathbf{X}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first principal component direction of the data is the line along which the observations vary the most.\n",
    "\n",
    "Put another way, the first principal component direction is the line such that if the observations were projected onto the line then the projected observations would have the largest possible variance and projecting observations onto any other line would yield projected observations with lower variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another interpretation of principal component analysis describes the first principal component vector as the line that is as close as possible to the data. In other words, the first principal component line minimizes the sum of the squared perpendicular distances between each point and the line. This means that the first principal component is chosen such that the projected observations are as close as possible to the original observations.\n",

    "It is necessary to consider only linear combinations of the form $\\phi^2_{11} + \\phi^2_{21} = 1$ because otherwise $\\phi_{11}$ and $\\phi_{21}$ could be increased arbitrarily to exaggerate the variance.\n",

    "## The Principal Component Regression Approach\n",
    "The principal component regression approach first constructs the first M principal components, $Z_{1}, Z_{2}, ..., Z_{M}$, and then uses the components as the predictors in a linear regression model that is fit with least squares.\n",
    "\n",
    "The premise behind this approach is that a small number of principal components can often suffice to explain most of the variability in the data as well as the relationship between the predictors and the response. This relies on the assumption that the directions in which $X_{1}, ..., X_{p}$ show the most variation are the directions that are associated with the predictor Y. Though not always true, it is true often enough to approximate good results.\n",
    "\n",
    "In scenarios where the assumption underlying principal component regression holds true, then the result of fitting a model to $Z_{1}, ..., Z_{M}$ will likely be better than the result of fitting a model to $X_{1}, ..., X_{p}$ since most of the information in the data that relates to the response is captured by $Z_{1}, ..., Z_{M}$ and by estimating only $M \\ll p$ coefficients overfitting is mitigated.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of principal components used relates to the bias-variance trade-off in that using fewer principal components will increase bias, but reduce variance and conversely, using more principal components will decrease bias, but increase variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Principal component regression will tend to do better in scenarios where fewer principal components are sufficient to capture most of the variation in the predictors and the relation with response. The closer $M$ is to $p$, the more principal component regression will resemble the results of a least squares model fit to the original predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "It should be noted that principal component regression is not a feature selection method since each of the $M$ principal components used in the regression is a linear combination of all $p$ original predictors. For this reason, principal component regression is more similar to ridge regression than it is to the lasso. In fact, it can be shown that principal component regression and ridge regression are closely related with ridge regression acting as a continuous version of principle component regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "As with the shrinkage methods, the value chosen for $M$ is best informed by cross-validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is generally recommended that all predictors be standardized prior to generating principal components. As with ridge regression, standardization can be achieved via\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\normalsize \\widetilde{x}_{ij} = \\frac{X_{ij}}{\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\n",
    "(X_{ij} - \\bar{x}_{j})^{2}}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Standardization ensures all variables are on the same scale which limits the degree to which the high-variance predictors dominate the principal components obtained. Additionally, the scale on which the variables are measured will ultimately affect the principal component regression model obtained. That said, if the variables are all in the same units, one might choose not to standardize them."

    "## Partial Least Squares\n",
    "Unlike principal component regression, partial least squares is a supervised learning method in that the value of the response is used to supervise the dimension reduction process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Partial least squares (PLS) identifies a new set of features $Z_{1}, ...,\n",
    "Z_{M}$  that are linear combinations of the original predictors and then uses these $M$ new features to fit a linear model using least squares.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike principal component regression, partial least squares makes use of the response $\\mathbf{Y}$ to identify new features that not only approximate the original predictors well, but that are also related to the response.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first partial least squares component is computed by first standardizing the $p$ predictors. Next, the values of each $\\phi_{j1}$ coefficient is set by performing a simple linear regression of  $\\mathbf{Y}$ onto  $\\mathbf{X}_j$. It can be shown that the derived coefficient is proportional to the correlation between $\\mathbf{Y}$ and $\\mathbf{X}_j$. Because of this proportional relationship, it can be seen that partial least squares places the highest weight on variables that are most strongly related to the response as it computes\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\normalsize Z_{1} = \\sum_{j=1}^{p} \\phi_{j1}X_{j}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "To identify the second partial least squares direction, it is first necessary to adjust each of the variables for $Z_1$. This is achieved by regressing each variable onto $Z_1$ and taking the residuals. These residuals can be interpreted as the remaining information not explained by the first partial least squares direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "This orthogonalized data is used to compute $Z_2$ in the same way that the original data was used to compute $Z_1$. This iterative approach can be repeated $M$ times to identify multiple partial least squares components, $Z_{1}, ..., Z_{M}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like principal component regression, the number of partial least squares directions, $M$, used with partial least squares is generally selected using cross validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before performing partial least squares, the predictors and the response are typically standardized.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, partial least squares often performs no better than principal component regression or ridge regression. Though the supervised dimension reduction of partial least squares can reduce bias, it also has the potential to increase variance. Because of this, the benefit of partial least squares compared to principal component regression is often negligible."

    "## Considerations For High-Dimensional Data\n",
    "Most statistical techniques for regression and classification are intended for low dimensional settings where $p \\ll n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data containing more features than observations are often referred to as __high-dimensional__.\n",
    "\n",
    "When $p \\geq n$, least squares will yield a set of coefficient estimates that perfectly fit the data whether or not there is truly a relationship between the features and the response. As such, least squares should never be used in a high-dimensional setting.\n",
    "\n",
    "$C_p$, AIC, and BIC are also not appropriate in the high-dimensional setting because estimating $\\sigma^2$ is problematic.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Regression in High Dimensions\n",
    "Methods for generating less flexible least squares models like forward stepwise selection, ridge regression, and the lasso turn out to be especially useful in the high-dimensional setting, since they essentially avoid overfitting by using a less flexible fitting approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regularization and/or shrinkage play a key role in high-dimensional problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Appropriate tuning parameter selection is crucial for good predictive performance in the high-dimensional setting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Test error tends to increase as the dimension of the problem increases unless the additional features are truly associated with the response. This is related to the __curse of dimensionality__, as the additional noise features increase the dimensionality of the problem, increasing the risk of overfitting without any potential upside.\n",
    "\n",
    "The risk of __multicollinearity__ is also exacerbated in the high-dimensional setting. Since any variable in the model can be written as a linear combination of all the other variables in the model, it can be extremely difficult to determine which variables (if any) are truly predictive of the outcome. Even the best regression coefficient estimates can never be identified. The best that can be hoped for is that large regression coefficients are assigned to the variables that are truly predictive of the outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the high-dimensional setting, one should __never__ use sum of squared errors, $p$-values, $R^2$, or other traditional measures of model fit on the training data as evidence of good model fit. MSE or $R^2$ of an independent test set is a valid measure of model fit, but MSE or $R^2$ of the training set is certainly not."
